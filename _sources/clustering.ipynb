    "## Overview \n",
    "As part of exploratory data analysis, it is often helpful to see if there are\n",
    "meaningful subgroups (or *clusters*) in the data. \n",
    "This grouping can be used for many purposes, \n",
    "such as generating new questions or improving predictive analyses. \n",
    "This chapter provides an introduction to clustering \n",
    "using the K-means algorithm,\n",
    "including techniques to choose the number of clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Chapter learning objectives \n",
    "By the end of the chapter, readers will be able to do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Describe a case where clustering is appropriate, \n",
    "and what insight it might extract from the data.\n",
    "* Explain the K-means clustering algorithm.\n",
    "* Interpret the output of a K-means analysis.\n",
    "* Differentiate between clustering and classification.\n",
    "* Identify when it is necessary to scale variables before clustering and do this using Python\n",

    "## Clustering\n",
    "Clustering \\index{clustering} is a data analysis task \n",
    "involving separating a data set into subgroups of related data. \n",
    "For example, we might use clustering to separate a\n",
    "data set of documents into groups that correspond to topics, a data set of\n",
    "human genetic information into groups that correspond to ancestral\n",
    "subpopulations, or a data set of online customers into groups that correspond\n",
    "to purchasing behaviors.  Once the data are separated, we can, for example,\n",
    "use the subgroups to generate new questions about the data and follow up with a\n",
    "predictive modeling exercise. In this course, clustering will be used only for\n",
    "exploratory analysis, i.e., uncovering patterns in the data.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that clustering is a fundamentally different kind of task \n",
    "than classification or regression. \n",
    "In particular, both classification and regression are *supervised tasks* \n",
    "\\index{classification}\\index{regression}\\index{supervised} \n",
    "where there is a *response variable* (a category label or value), \n",
    "and we have examples of past data with labels/values \n",
    "that help us predict those of future data. \n",
    "By contrast, clustering is an *unsupervised task*, \n",
    "\\index{unsupervised} as we are trying to understand \n",
    "and examine the structure of data without any response variable labels \n",
    "or values to help us. \n",
    "This approach has both advantages and disadvantages. \n",
    "Clustering requires no additional annotation or input on the data. \n",
    "For example, it would be nearly impossible to annotate \n",
    "all the articles on Wikipedia with human-made topic labels. \n",
    "However, we can still cluster the articles without this information \n",
    "to find groupings corresponding to topics automatically. \n",
    "\n",
    "Given that there is no response variable, it is not as easy to evaluate\n",
    "the \"quality\" of a clustering.  With classification, we can use a test data set\n",
    "to assess prediction performance. In clustering, there is not a single good\n",
    "choice for evaluation. In this book, we will use visualization to ascertain the\n",
    "quality of a clustering, and leave rigorous evaluation for more advanced\n",
    "courses.  \n",
    "\n",
    "As in the case of classification, \n",
    "there are many possible methods that we could use to cluster our observations \n",
    "to look for subgroups. \n",
    "In this book, we will focus on the widely used K-means \\index{K-means} algorithm [@kmeans]. \n",
    "In your future studies, you might encounter hierarchical clustering,\n",
    "principal component analysis, multidimensional scaling, and more; \n",

    "for where to begin learning more about these other methods.\n",

    "> but the vast majority don't. \n",
    "> The goal is to try to uncover underlying structure in the data \n",
    "> that allows one to guess the missing labels. \n",
